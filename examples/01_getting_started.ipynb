    "## What is Simulated Annealing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulated Annealing (SA) is a heuristical algorithm used for finding a global optimum in a complex search space. It is particularly effective for complex combinatorial optimization problems where the number of possible solutions is too vast for an exhaustive search or even an exact solver.\n",
    "It's a probabilistic metaheuristic which uses controlled randomness to guide its search. While it doesn't guarantee finding the global optimum, it systematically increases the probability of finding a good solution fast and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is inspired by the physical process of annealing in metallurgy, where a metal is heated to a high temperature and then slowly cooled. This process settles the metal's atoms into a very low-energy, highly-ordered crystalline structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "SA uses this analogy to explore a problem's energy landscape — a map of all possible solutions and their corresponding costs (or \"energy\").\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The algorithm starts at a hot initial temperature, allowing it to accept new solution candidates frequently in the beginning, even accepting \"worse\" solutions (uphill moves) to avoid getting trapped in local minima. This is called the exploration phase.\n",
    "-   As the algorithm progresses, the temperature gets reduced based on a controled cooling scheme. The lower the temperature, the lower the willingness to accept worse solutions. It begins to settle into the deepest valleys it has discovered. This is the called exploitation phase."

    "For the sake of this tutorial, we'll use a simple, yet non-trivial 4-variable QUBO with a known local minimum and a known global optimum. The goal is to find the binary vector $x$ that minimizes the energy $E = x^T Q x$.\n",

    "-   **Local Minimum:** The state **`[0, 1, 0, 1]`** has an energy of $Q_{11} + Q_{33} = -1 + (-1) = -2.0$. While not as good as -4.0, any single bit flip from *this* state also results in a higher energy, making it a stable \"valley\" in the energy landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "The off-diagonal values ($Q_{01}=3$ and $Q_{23}=3$) act as penalties. They make it energetically unfavorable to have both $x_0, x_1$ active at the same time, or both $x_2, x_3$ active. The challenge for the solver is to find its way out of the `-2.0` valley to discover the deeper `-4.0` one."

    "The behavior of the solver is controlled by the following key parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initial Temperature (`initial_temp`):** The starting temperature. It must be high enough to allow the solver to freely explore the entire energy landscape. If it's too low, the solver might get stuck in the first minimum it finds.\n",
    "* **Final Temperature (`final_temp`):** The temperature at which the algorithm stops. It should be close to zero, ensuring the solver has \"frozen\" into a stable, low-energy solution.\n",
    "* **Cooling Schedule (`schedule` & `schedule_params`):** This function controls how the temperature decreases over time. The `quasar-solver` supports two cooling schedules: geometric and adaptive. The cooling rate controls the rate of cooling or, more figuratively speaking, how fast the solver goes deeper into the energy landscape. If it's too fast, the system gets \"quenched\" in a poor state; if it's too slow, the solver takes too long. \n",
    "* **Iterations Per Temperature (`iterations_per_temp`):** Also known as the Markov chain length. This is the number of steps the solver takes at each temperature level. It must be long enough for the system to reach a stable state (\"thermal equilibrium\") before cooling down further.\n",
    "\n",
